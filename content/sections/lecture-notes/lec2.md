description: Part 2, Chapter 1 (Galaxies) of the course lecture notes. The lecture
  notes were taken in the Fall of 2001 by Jeremy Schnittman, who as a student in the
  subject, agreed to take notes and to format them using LaTeX. He used Professor
  Paul Schechter's handwritten notes in producing them. The figures were produced
  by Caitlin Millard during June-August 2004. Used with permission. As of the date
  of publication, only lecture notes for sessions 1 through 11 were available.
